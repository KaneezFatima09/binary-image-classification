# Cat vs Dog Image Classification
## Project Overview

This project is a binary image classification task where the model predicts whether a given image is of a cat or a dog.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to automatically learn visual features from the dataset.
